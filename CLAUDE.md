# Project Instructions

## Pre-Commit Quality Gates

All quality gates run automatically via Husky on every `git commit`, scoped to the file types you staged:

| Staged file type | Checks that run automatically |
|---|---|
| `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.js` / `.jsx` | eslint (staged only), `tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` |
| `.swift` | swiftlint (staged only), `npm run test:ios` |
| `.kt` / `.kts` | `compileStandardDebugKotlin` (type check), `lintStandardDebug`, `npm run test:android` |

**Requirements:**
- SwiftLint: `brew install swiftlint` (skipped with a warning if not installed)
- Android checks require the Gradle wrapper in `android/`

Before writing new code, ensure tests exist for your changes. If the hook fails, fix the issue and recommit — never skip with `--no-verify`.

## Push = Create PR + Address Review

When asked to push code, follow this full workflow:

0. ensure that you are on a branch that is specific to this change i.e feat/new-feature or fix/bug-fix or docs/update-readme or chore/update-dependencies, or test/new-test, etc
1. Push the branch to the remote (`git push -u origin <branch>`)
2. Create a PR using `gh pr create`. Ensure that you are adhering to the PR template
3. Wait for Gemini to review the PR (poll with `gh pr checks` and `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews` until a review appears)
4. Once a review exists, pull down the review comments: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments` and `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews`
5. Address every review comment — fix the code, re-run the quality gates (tests, lint, tsc). Resole the comment appropriately post that on the PR directly.
6. Push the fixes
7. Report what was changed in response to the review
